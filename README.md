The Daniel Tiger Lookup project is meant as a way for parents to easily lookup Daniel Tiger episodes for their children to watch based on their child's needs. It implements hash tables and linked list data structures to store the information. The parent receives the Daniel Tiger season and episode, as well as a link to the episode song on youtube. Main program is under script.py, but all files need to be downloaded to run.
